\f0\fs24 \cf0 For this assignment I used several web resources.  For alot of canvas information and drawing I used the w3 school tutorials found online. I also used {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.fractalcurves.com/Turtle.html"}}{\fldrslt http://www.fractalcurves.com/Turtle.html}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://codepen.io/hoodwink73/pen/ozfFg"}}{\fldrslt https://codepen.io/hoodwink73/pen/ozfFg}} as a guideline to calculating the fractals. Most of the code is modified for this assignment and for the wheel part of the assignment I based code off of my other canvas drawing tutorials on w3 school. \
