WEEK 2 PROGRESS REPORTChristopher KeoWeek 2 - In my 2nd week of the project I have accomplished many things. First the user now has the ability to render a house with colors of their choosing. I implemented a way to choose roof and house color which then draws 3d triangles and squares to make the house. After the image is rendered you can also now move the object by hovering over the item and moving the mouse.Week 3 Preview - I want to add a control menu that edits and renders different attributes without having to refresh the page. I also want to add textures and maybe the ability to scale the house afterwards.
