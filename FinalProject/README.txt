For this assignment I used several web resources.  I used the website three.js  and w3 schools for the tutorials on how to create 3D objects with javascript. I also watched tutorial videos of three.js on youtube since it was my first time using that library. 

On my week 1 progress I was able to create a cube in what I hope is the beginning of creating a 3d house. Since this was my first time with three.js I have only made the cube with the ability to rotate, and drawn as wires or solids. By next week I hope to add a roof and windows/doors to the house while also adding orbit control.
